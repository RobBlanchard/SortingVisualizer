# Sorting Visualizer

## Demo

You can find a demo of my visualizer here : https://robblanchard.github.io/SortingVisualizer/

## Objectives 
This repository has two objectives:
* First, implement various sorting algorithms in Python and create an executable (this part of the project has been dropped).
* Second, create a sorting visualizer in ReactJS

This project has been started to implement my own version from scratch of **Cl√©ment Mihailescu**'s Sorting Visualizer which you can find here: https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer.  

I made this project to get my hands on React programming.

### TO DO

Python : 
- [ ] Optimize sorting algorithms
- [ ] Create an exectutable  

React :
- [x] Deploy GitHub page
- [x] Merge Sort
- [X] Lomuto Quick Sort
- [X] Customizable array sizes and sorting speed
- [ ] History feature : go back in time
- [ ] More sorting algorithms
- [ ] Swapping animation (FLIP)
