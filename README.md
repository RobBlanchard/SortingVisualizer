# Sorting Visualizer

## Demo

You can find a demo of my visualizer here : https://robblanchard.github.io/SortingVisualizer/

## Objectives 
This repository has two objectives:
* First, implement various sorting algorithms in Python and create an executable.
* Second, create a sorting visualizer in ReactJS

This project has been started to implement my own version from scratch of **Cl√©ment Mihailescu**'s Sorting Visualizer which you can find here: https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer.
I made this project to get my hands on React programming.

### TO DO:
* Deploy GitHub page https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages DONE
* Add other sorting algorithms DONE
    * Merge Sort DONE
    * Classic quick sort DONE
* Modify Insertion Sort visualisation DONE
    * Add non-swapping comparison
    * Add changes to visualisation
* Update README with instructions
* Add customizable array sizes and sorting speed DONE
